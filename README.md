Odin Recipes Project

Overview

Welcome to my "Odin Recipes" project, part of my journey through The Odin Project's Foundations Course. This project is a hands-on 
opportunity to apply and showcase the HTML skills I've been learning. It involves building a simple yet functional recipe website.

Project Goals

The primary aim of this project is to strengthen my understanding of HTML. The website will initially have a basic design, focusing on HTML 
structure and content. Styling with CSS will be added in future iterations.

Features

Main Index Page: Serves as the homepage with links to various recipes.
Individual Recipe Pages: Each recipe has its own dedicated page detailing the ingredients, preparation steps, and images.
Learning Outcomes

Understanding and applying basic HTML tags and structures.
Version Control with Git and GitHub: Managing and organizing the project as a portfolio on GitHub, demonstrating practical use of version 
control.
Commit Best Practices: Implementing frequent and meaningful commits, showcasing a disciplined approach to version control and tracking 
project evolution.
Web Navigation: Creating a user-friendly navigation system between the main index page and individual recipe pages, enhancing the user 
experience.
Content Management: Organizing and presenting content in a structured and readable format.
Future Enhancements

While the current focus is on HTML, I plan to revisit this project to:

Implement CSS for styling and layout improvements.
Integrate interactive features using JavaScript.
Viewing the Project

This project is hosted using GitHub Pages, making it accessible for public viewing and providing a real-world application of my learning 
progress.

Reflection

This project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce my HTML skills. It's an opportunity for self-evaluation and understanding how these 
foundational skills will contribute to my growth as a web developer.
